## What can you do?
If you know a popular algorithm, that you think can be beneficial for others, fork this repo, add the code and create a PR. **It can be in any Language !!! (Programming ofcourse)**.<br><br>
**Do remember that your single contribution can make a person's interview successful !!!**

## How to do it?
- Add a star to this repo, because you are a star yourself :star: :star:
- Fork this repo :fork_and_knife:
- Create a new branch
- Create a clone on your local machine :computer:
- Add the algorithm's code in the language specific folder. If you don't see a folder for your chosen language, create one for yourself. Make sure you keep your file's name similar to your algorithm's name.
- Add your name and profile link to Contributors.md (Alphabetical order would be :heart:)
- Commit the changes to your fork, then a create a sweet sweet PR

## Do note that
- After creating a PR, please mention that PR in the issue comments.
- Before starting to work on this, ask for an assign over your chosen algorithm, or mention which algorithm you'll be working on in the comments.
- Please Be respectful to everyone. The world is already a messed up place, why add more bad stuff to it.
- If you see that your chosen algorithm is already present in one language and you feel like you can do it in some other language, be my guest !

## Wanna stand out from the crowd?
- Be the sunshine of somebody's learning life and add some definition or theory about the algorithm in your code as comment :heart:
- If you can, add the link to the video resources where you learnt the algorithm from ! :clapper:
- Try to add more resources, links or PDF links about your algorithm in the code as comments.
- **Don't forget that you are AWESOME!!!!!!!**
